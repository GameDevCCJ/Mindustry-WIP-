# Mindustry Classic -WIP-
Before you read the description of the game, please note we are trying to get this legendary game unblocked at the moment. So far, this has taken a few months. Do not execpt this to be done very soon. I will update you on the situation once we (OMEGA and I) get any further.

Mindustry Classic is a Factorio like game where you build conveyors, drills, extractors to gather resources to build walls and turrets to defend against the incoming enemy waves. Build massive factories and strategically place your defense against the enemy, all while you gain resources. 

Mindustry Classic is in a series called "Mindustry" which contains two games. Mindustry, and Mindustry Classic. You can play Mindustry on STEAM for $10 USD.
